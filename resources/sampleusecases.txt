cortex_summarize — Summarizes impacted procedures by department and criticality
execute_query — Retrieves document metadata including last update dates and document owners

Sample Interaction:

"Find all operational procedures that reference the Legacy CorePlus system and categorize them by department, with a summary of what needs to be updated for the migration."

Value: Reduces process documentation audit from 3 weeks of manual review to 2 days of automated discovery.

Real-Time Procedure Clarification
Scenario: A fraud analyst is reviewing a suspicious ACH transaction and needs to confirm the correct escalation path for potential elder financial exploitation cases.
MCP Tools Used:

cortex_search_query — Retrieves elder abuse reporting procedures and escalation matrices
cortex_analyst_query — Queries the customer's profile for age and account activity patterns
cortex_sentiment — Analyzes recent customer service notes for indicators of distress or confusion

 Cross-Departmental Process Coordination
Scenario: A commercial loan officer needs to understand the documentation handoff process between Commercial Lending, Credit Risk, Legal, and Loan Operations for a complex syndicated loan.
MCP Tools Used:

cortex_search_query — Searches process documentation across multiple departmental repositories
cortex_agent_run — Synthesizes information from multiple sources into a unified workflow view
get_query_history — Retrieves previous queries on this topic to maintain context

Sample Interaction:

"Map the complete document flow and approval chain for syndicated commercial loans over $10M, including responsibilities for each department and SLA timelines."

Value: Eliminates process ambiguity that typically causes 2-3 day delays in complex loan closings.

Audit Trail and Process Evidence
Scenario: Internal audit is reviewing wire transfer procedures and needs to demonstrate that operations staff have access to current, version-controlled procedure documentation.
MCP Tools Used:

cortex_search_query — Retrieves procedure documents with version metadata
execute_query — Pulls document access logs showing staff engagement with procedures
cortex_analyst_query — Generates statistics on procedure document views by role and department

Sample Interaction:

"Generate a report showing wire transfer procedure documents, their last revision dates, approval signatures, and access statistics by operations staff over the past 90 days."

Value: Provides auditors with immediate evidence of procedure governance and staff awareness.

Disaster Recovery Procedure Access
Scenario: A regional outage has occurred, and the business continuity team needs immediate access to the disaster recovery runbook for the payment processing systems.
MCP Tools Used:

cortex_search_query — Rapidly retrieves DR procedures for specific systems
cortex_summarize — Provides executive summary of critical first-hour actions
cortex_analyst_query — Queries system dependency data to identify downstream impacts

Sample Interaction:

"Retrieve the disaster recovery procedures for the ACH processing system, prioritized by RTO criticality, and identify all dependent downstream systems."

Value: Reduces DR procedure retrieval from 15 minutes of manual searching to 30 seconds during critical incidents.


Procedure Gap Identification
Scenario: Following a near-miss operational incident, the risk team needs to determine if existing procedures adequately cover the scenario that almost caused a loss.
MCP Tools Used:

cortex_search_query — Searches for procedures related to the incident type
cortex_agent_run — Analyzes the incident details against existing procedures and identifies coverage gaps
cortex_complete — Drafts recommended procedure additions based on the gap analysis

Sample Interaction:

"We had a near-miss where a duplicate payment was almost released due to a system timeout. Search our procedures for duplicate payment detection and identify if there are gaps in handling system timeout scenarios."
